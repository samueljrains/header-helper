Example
=============

Assuming you want to add a state field on your input form and your field is called 'state'.  The add.ctp line would contain:

`echo $this->Form->input('state', array('type'=>'select', 'options'=>$this->Header->getState()));`

Edit.ctp would contain:

`echo $this->Form->input('state', array('type'=>'select', 'options'=>$this->Header->getState($this->request->data['YourArray']['state'])));`

Where `$this->request->data['YourArray']['state'])));` would be the correct name of the model you are using.
